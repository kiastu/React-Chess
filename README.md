Lightweight chess app built with React. A learning side project.


## Development:
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

Create-react-app is a pretty sweet tool for learning react. Instructions for using it are found in the link above, but tl;dr, executing `npm start` will start up a server that will serve your application to locahost:3000. Upon saving your files, the service will automagically display your changes in the browser.

Sweet!

If using sublime text for development, highly suggest picking up the babel syntax highlighting kit, otherwise the syntax highlighting will just be a sad, sad joke :(
